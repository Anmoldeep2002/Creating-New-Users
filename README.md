<br />

<h2>Step-by-Step Walk-Through:</h2>

STEP 1 (Creating Client Account): <br/>

<p align="center">Here, I'll create a new user to represent a new employee at an organisation. The new user's name will be John, and I will create new login details for him, including a domain username and a password. After the account is created, the new user John will be able to login with a device connected within the domain. To create a new user, first navigate to Active Directory Users and Computers. As you can see, the "USERS" folder has many users, but not one named "John". In this situation, I'll create the user "John" right now.</p>

<p align="center">Now, I right-click on the "USERS" folder to view its settings.</p>

<p align="center">Now, I hover over the "NEW" section to open other options, then select the "User" option. After clicking on it, I'll be able to create the login details for the new user.</p>

STEP 2: <br/>

<p align="center">From here, I can generate login information for the new user. As you can see from the first image, all of the fields are blank and need to be filled with information for the new user. On the second image, I've entered all of the information required for the new user John. I've added both a name and a user login name. I now move on to the next step by clicking "Next".</p>

<p align="center">I then set a password for the user and selected "Next" to move on to the next step.</p>

<p align="center">This is the final stage in generating the user, and it displays a summary of the information I submitted for the user, such as their name and login name. I then click the "Finish" button to successfully create the new user.</p>

<p align="center">As you can see, the new user John has been successfully created and is now visible in the "Users" folder. I can now manage this user from the domain controller and make the required changes to ensure that the account can be used successfully.</p>

STEP 3 (Creating Helpdesk Account): <br/>

<p align="center">In this stage, I'll set up an account for the Helpdesk person. This will allow the helpdesk person to access a device within the domain. As you can see, the account has been created.</p>

<p align="center">I signed in to the "HELPDESK" account on the Windows 10 PC. As you can see, it successfully signed in and displayed a "Welcome" message under the user's name.</p>
